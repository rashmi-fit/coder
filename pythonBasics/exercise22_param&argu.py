Q3. Recall that if s is string, then s.find('a') 
will find the location of list a in s. 
The problem is that it does not find the location of every a.
 Write a function called findall that given a string and 
 a single character, returns a list containing all of the 
 locations of that character in the string. It should return an empty list 
 if there are no occurences o fthe character in list.
